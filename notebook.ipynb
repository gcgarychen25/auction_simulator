        "\n",
        "This project implements a sophisticated **multi-agent auction environment** for real-estate transactions, featuring:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **5 Distinct Buyer Personas**: Conservative, Aggressive, Analytical, Budget-Conscious, and FOMO\n",
        "- **Agent implementation from heuristic to RL to LLM**\n",
        "- **English Auction Format**: Ascending price mechanism with strategic bidding\n",
        "- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Economic efficiency metrics and behavioral analysis\n",
        "- **RL-Ready Architecture**: Gymnasium-compatible environment for reinforcement learning\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚀 **Three-Phase Development Roadmap**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Phase 0: Foundation & Validation** 🔍\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Smoke test and architecture validation\n",
        "- **Approach**: Single episode with heuristic agents\n",
        "- **Output**: Basic functionality demonstration\n",
        "- **Key Metrics**: Episode completion, action parsing, environment stability\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Phase 1: Monte Carlo Baseline** 📊\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Establish statistical baseline with heuristic policies\n",
        "- **Approach**: Configurable episodes (50-1000+) with comprehensive analytics\n",
        "- **Output**: `reports/phase1_analysis.md` with efficiency metrics\n",
        "- **Key Metrics**: Allocative efficiency, revenue efficiency, persona performance\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning** 🧠\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Train RL agents and compare against heuristic baseline\n",
        "- **Approach**: Configurable PPO training + evaluation episodes\n",
        "- **Output**: `reports/phase2_analysis.md` with RL vs heuristic comparison\n",
        "- **Key Metrics**: Allocative efficiency, revenue efficiency, price distribution\n",
        "- notes: did not tune the hyperparameters for RL agents, so the results are not optimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Phase 3: LLM Multi-Agent Simulation** 🤖\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Simulate complex, human-like negotiation and qualitative decision-making.\n",
        "- **Approach**: A multi-agent system where both Buyer and Seller agents are powered by LLMs (Gemini). Agents engage in a Q&A phase before each bidding round, allowing them to gather information and act strategically based on their unique personas and requirements defined in `config.yaml`.\n",
        "- **Output**: A detailed, human-readable transcript of the auction, including agent commentary, questions, and answers.\n",
        "- **Key Metrics**: N/A.\n",
        "- notes: realistic conversation between buyer and seller and the auction outcomes.\n",
