## Analysis & Interpretation

The RL agents demonstrate a significant shift in market dynamics compared to the heuristic baseline. While the average price remained relatively stable, allocative efficiency saw a notable decrease, suggesting that the learned policies are less effective at ensuring the highest-value buyer wins. This is reflected in the altered winner distribution, where historically dominant aggressive buyers lost market share to more conservative or budget-conscious agents.

The reduction in total economic surplus under the RL regime, combined with lower efficiency, indicates that the current agent strategies are suboptimal from a market welfare perspective. However, the increased price volatility suggests that RL agents introduced more complex and less predictable bidding patterns, which could be a foundation for more sophisticated strategies with further training.

## Note on Learning Curves

This report is based on final evaluation data. A complete analysis of agent learning would require training logs containing per-episode rewards and other metrics to generate learning curves and analyze market evolution during training. This data was not available for the current analysis.

## Recommendations for Future Development
1. **Extended Training:** Longer training may be required for agents to converge on more optimal policies.
2. **Reward Shaping:** Review and refine reward functions to better incentivize efficient market outcomes.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize learning rates, exploration strategies, and other PPO parameters.
4. **State Representation:** Consider enriching the agent's state with more information about opponent behavior.
