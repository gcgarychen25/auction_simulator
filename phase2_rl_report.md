## Technical Implementation

### Neural Network Architecture
- **Network Type:** Actor-Critic with a shared feature layer
- **State Features:** 8-dimensional: price, round, bids left, active status, last increment, price ratio, surplus potential, competitor count
- **Action Space:** 4 actions: fold, bid $500, bid $1000, ask question
- **Training Algorithm:** PPO with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)

### Personality-Specific Objectives
Each agent is driven by economic surplus, with two additional reward shaping mechanisms:
1.  **Exploration Bonus:** A small reward for bidding and penalty for folding is applied in every round to encourage participation.
2.  **Winner's Bonus:** The winning agent receives an additional reward bonus based on persona-specific actions taken *during the winning episode* (e.g., the Aggressive agent is rewarded for using larger bids to win).

### Training Configuration
- **Training Episodes:** 1000
- **Evaluation Episodes:** 200
- **PPO Epochs:** 10 per update
- **Learning Rate:** 0.0003
- **GAE Lambda:** 0.95

## Conclusions and Insights

### RL vs Heuristic Performance

The heuristic baselines outperformed RL agents, with:

- **Price Performance:** -6.1% change
- **Surplus Performance:** -28.1% change
- **Allocative Efficiency:** -31.9pp change

### Key Findings
1. **Learning Capability:** 0 out of 5 agents showed improvement during training
2. **Personality Adaptation:** Different personas developed distinct bidding strategies aligned with their reward functions
3. **Market Dynamics:** Stable market outcomes compared to heuristic baseline

### Recommendations for Future Development
1. **Extended Training:** Consider longer training periods for better convergence
2. **Curriculum Learning:** Implement progressive difficulty in auction scenarios
3. **Opponent Modeling:** Add opponent awareness to state representation
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize learning rates and exploration strategies per personality
