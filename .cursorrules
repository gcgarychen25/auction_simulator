Standard Git Workflow:
1. For any new feature or bug fix, create a new feature branch from an up-to-date main branch (e.g., `git checkout -b new-feature`).
2. Once work is complete, open a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.
3. After the pull request is merged, switch back to your local main branch, pull the latest changes, and then delete the now-merged local feature branch (e.g., `git checkout main && git pull origin main && git branch -d new-feature`).
